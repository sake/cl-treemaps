README: cl-treemaps
===================

cl-treemaps is an implementation of various binary trees for Common Lisp. The
interface is derived from the Common Lisp hash-table.

Currently only red-black trees are implemented. But AA trees and possibly others
will follow shortly in time.


Dependencies
============

The cl-treemaps package itself doesn't have any dependencies. The test part
however needs FiveAM.


Version History
===============

0.1
===
+ Red black trees implemented with top down iterative algorithm.
  Big credits to Julienne Walker for supplying the necesary insights.
  (http://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_rbtree.aspx)
+ Red black split and merge use insert to create new tree instead of reusing
  an existing one. This will be fixed when I fully embrace the internal working
  of the data structure.
+ Tests and examples on how to use the tree are also included.
+ The implementation is still not optimzed (see compiler warnings). Hints are
  welcome.
